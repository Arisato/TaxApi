2. Add your connection string to ```appsettings.json``` located in the TaxLedgerAPI folder.
3. In the Visual Studio Package Manager Console window utilising Entity Framework run the following context scaffolding command:
   ```
   Scaffold-DbContext 'Name=ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection' Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -Context 'Context' -Project DataEF -StartupProject TaxLedgerAPI -o Models -ContextDir ../DataEF -NoOnConfiguring -f
   ```
7. Run the app.
8. To visually observe api's and execute any endpoints against your database via UI you can simply input your local host link followed by /swagger in your browser window. Example: ```https://localhost:0000/swagger```.
